## 🎁 Phase 1: Get Your Free Kiro Credits

### Step 1: Download Kiro IDE

Visit **[kiro.dev](https://kiro.dev)** and download the application for your platform.

### Step 2: Sign Up & Login

1. Open Kiro IDE
2. Create a new account or sign in
3. ✨ **You'll automatically receive 500 free credits!**

> ⚠️ **Important:** Keep Kiro IDE logged in throughout this setup process.

## 🌐 Phase 2: Set Up Kiro OpenAI Gateway

This gateway creates a local server that translates OpenAI-compatible requests to Kiro's API, allowing you to use your free credits with any OpenAI-compatible tool.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jwadow/kiro-openai-gateway.git
cd kiro-openai-gateway
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Configure Environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
> This command creates a new .env file by copying all the contents from .env.example.

### step 4: Uncomment

> `# KIRO_CREDS_FILE="~/.aws/sso/cache/kiro-auth-token.json"` uncomment this line in .env file.
> 
- **Note**: Open the terminal on this directory **kiro-openai-gateway** where we have all the kiro code base and run this command `python main.py`.If the server is successfully running so it's means that your .env file is loaded successfully and you don't need to implement step  `Step 5: Setup Variables` to set this 2 environment variable manually `KIRO_CREDS_FILE` and `PROXY_API_KEY`.

### Step 5: Setup Variables

Before starting the server, you need to set the required environment variables for Kiro credentials and your proxy API key.

### Windows (Command Prompt)

```cmd
:: Set the path to your Kiro credentials JSON file
set KIRO_CREDS_FILE=C:/Users/TechLink/.aws/sso/cache/kiro-auth-token.json

:: Set your super-secret proxy API key
set PROXY_API_KEY=my-super-secret-password-123
```

⚠ Note: These set commands only last for the current terminal session.
If you close the terminal, you will need to set them again.

### Linux / Ubuntu (Bash)

Before starting the Kiro Gateway server, set the required environment variables in your terminal:

```bash
# Set the path to your Kiro credentials JSON file
export KIRO_CREDS_FILE=~/.aws/sso/cache/kiro-auth-token.json

# Set your super-secret proxy API key
export PROXY_API_KEY=my-super-secret-password-123

```

⚠ Note: These export commands only last for the current terminal session.
To make them permanent, you can add them to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc.

### Step 6: Start the Gateway Server

```bash
python main.py
```

✅ **Success Indicator:** You should see:
```
Server running at http://localhost:8000
```

> 📌 Note: To check if the gateway is running, open your browser and go to:

http://localhost:8000

> You should **not** use `0.0.0.0` in the browser, as it is only a server binding address.

```bash
This site can’t be reached
The webpage at http://0.0.0.0:8000/ might be temporarily down or it may have moved permanently to a new web address.
ERR_ADDRESS_INVALID
```
You should convert this `http://0.0.0.0:8000` url into your localhost by running `python main.py --host 127.0.0.1` command in the terminal and close the old one. Then run this on the browser.

`http://127.0.0.1:8000/`


> It'll show something like this: `{"status":"ok","message":"Kiro Gateway is running","version":"2.0-rc.1"}` so it means that server is running successfully in the localhost.

You should stopped this server once checked it's working or The server must stay running.

## 🔀 Phase 3: Set Up Claude Code Router

The Claude Code Router wraps the official Claude CLI and redirects requests to your local Kiro gateway.

### Step 1: Install Required Packages

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
npm install -g @musistudio/claude-code-router
```
### Step 2: Create Configuration File

#### For windows users:

> Open the Start menu, type cmd, and press Enter. This will open the Command Prompt at your root directory. 

```bash
C:\Users\username
```

Then open the code editor(IDE) by running this command `code .`. There you find a `.claude-code-router` folder in that folder there is an file `config.json`.
 
**Windows Path:** `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\.claude-code-router\config.json` 
 
You just paste this script in `config.json` file:

```json
{
  "LOG": true,
  "LOG_LEVEL": "debug",
  "Providers": [
    {
      "name": "kiro",
      "api_base_url": "http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions",
      "api_key": "my-super-secret-password-123",
      "models": [
        "claude-sonnet-4-5",
        "claude-haiku-4-5",
        "claude-opus-4-5"
      ],
      "transformer": {
        "use": ["openrouter"]
      }
    }
  ],
  "Router": {
    "default": "kiro,claude-sonnet-4-5",
    "think": "kiro,claude-sonnet-4-5",
    "background": "kiro,claude-sonnet-4-5",
    "longContext": "kiro,claude-sonnet-4-5",
    "webSearch": "kiro,claude-sonnet-4-5"
  }
}
```
#### For Linux(ubuntu) users:

Open the ubuntu terminal.

Create or edit the file at: `~/.claude-code-router/config.json` by paste the following configuration:

```json
cat > ~/.claude-code-router/config.json << 'EOF'
{
  "LOG": true,
  "LOG_LEVEL": "debug",
  "Providers": [
    {
      "name": "kiro",
      "api_base_url": "http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions",
      "api_key": "my-super-secret-password-123",
      "models": [
        "claude-sonnet-4-5",
        "claude-haiku-4-5",
        "claude-opus-4-5"
      ],
      "transformer": {
        "use": ["openrouter"]
      }
    }
  ],
  "Router": {
    "default": "kiro,claude-sonnet-4-5",
    "think": "kiro,claude-sonnet-4-5",
    "background": "kiro,claude-sonnet-4-5",
    "longContext": "kiro,claude-sonnet-4-5",
    "webSearch": "kiro,claude-sonnet-4-5"
  }
}
EOF
```
- Note: Ensure the api_key matches the PROXY_API_KEY you set in Phase 2. The model name claude-sonnet-4-5 corresponds to the models provided by the Kiro Gateway.

### Configuration Explained

| Key | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `api_base_url` | Points to your local Kiro gateway |
| `api_key` | Must match `PROXY_API_KEY` in your `.env` file |
| `models` | Available Claude models through Kiro |
| `Router` | Maps different request types to providers |

## 🚀 Phase 4: Launch & Test

### Step 1: Start the Router Service

Open a **new terminal** and run:

```bash
ccr start
```

It's started the server in the background.

### Step 2: Run Claude Code

Instead of the standard `claude` command, use:

```bash
ccr code
```

### Step 3: Test Your Setup

Try a simple prompt:

```
Hi! Can you confirm you're working?
```

🎉 **Congratulations!** You're now using Claude Code with Kiro's free credits!

### Step 4: Check Model:

Check which model is running in the background run 

```bash 
ccr model
```

Click on backgroud model it'll showing the model which is used in the background.

## 🎯 Bonus: Get 500 More Free Credits with Kiro CLI

Once your IDE credits are exhausted, you can get **another 500 free credits** by installing Kiro CLI with the same account!

### Step 1: Install Kiro CLI

Follow the official installation guide: **[kiro.dev/docs/cli/installation](https://kiro.dev/docs/cli/installation)**

### Step 2: Login to Kiro CLI

```bash
kiro login
```

### Step 3: Update Environment Configuration

Edit your `.env` file in the `kiro-openai-gateway` folder:

**Remove or comment out:**
```bash
# KIRO_CREDS_FILE="~/.aws/sso/cache/kiro-auth-token.json"
```

**Add this line:**
```bash
KIRO_CLI_DB_FILE="~/.local/share/kiro-cli/data.sqlite3"
```

### Step 4: Update the Codebase

Use your IDE's **Find and Replace** feature:

| Find | Replace With |
|------|--------------|
| `KIRO_CREDS_FILE` | `KIRO_CLI_DB_FILE` |

Apply this replacement across the entire `kiro-openai-gateway` codebase.

### Step 5: Restart the Server

```bash
python main.py
```

✅ Your Kiro CLI credits are now active!
